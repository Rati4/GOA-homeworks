            Korean BBQ Short Ribs (Galbi)</li>
            <nesting>This is an easy way to make Korean short ribs.
                 You can also substitute chicken breast or sliced rib-eye for the short ribs. If you use chicken or rib-eye, you must add thinly sliced green onion tops.
                 This can also be broiled in the oven for the same amount of time.</nesting>
