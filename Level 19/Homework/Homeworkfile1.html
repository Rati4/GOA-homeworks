<p>that is georgian republic which has main citys of:kutaisi,tbilisi and more.
     their population was a lot and they had a decent economy
      georgia was not that peacefull country back then as it had to face big wars which suprisingly they won which im really impressed of.
       georgia has a lot of troops if any war happens georgias border is with russia,azerbaijan,armenia and turkey and it has a border in batumi which leads to beach which is very cool to go.</p>
