    <p>yes that is germany! and its allies and enemies germany was a low economic country because they had to face a lot of wars and because of this they spent it on the army. germans still lost in ww1 but they still won some battles.germany wasnt that weak as it stood strong when other countries attacked it but people didnt like war so they didnt continue and surrendered</p>
